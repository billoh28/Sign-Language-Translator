Changed dataset manipulation programs to include noise labels and to produce test data which is evenly distributed.
Pretrained model code was updated to predict for noise labels.
Spell checker program was also improved, and incoporated fully into parent.py.
The confusion matrix program was improved and renamed. This program, model_stats.py, takes multiple models and produces individual statistics and combined statistics on these models.
These statistics include confusion matrices and graphs showing number of correct and incorrect predictions for each label.
