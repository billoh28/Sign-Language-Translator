Created Parent program called parent.py which combines all necessary programs and models in order to produce predictions from a video.
Initially, parent.py used the three models described in the previous blog.
Confidence level function was introduced to parent.py to only take predictions over a certain confidence level in order to improve predictions.
Euclidean distance progam also incoporated into parent.py in an attempt to remove duplicate frames.
Implemented spell checking program as the CNN is fed intermediate frames, and the model attempts to predict these irrelevant frames.
Spell checker should reduce the impact of these irrelevant frames.
Also updated the pretrained model code.
