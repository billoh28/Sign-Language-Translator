Wrote CNN template to implement pre trained models.
Tested multiple Keras pretarined models to determine the best model to use for our data.
Tested these models in Google Colab and displayed results in tensorboard.
Determined that Xception produced the most consistent validation accuracy and validation loss.
Changed the dataset manipulation program in order to add random background noise to increase the generalisation.
