Wrote multiple programs to tune hyperparameters of CNN models.
CNN Model from scratch kept getting stuck at 55% accuracy with validation data.
Implemented kernel initialisers and L2 regularisation to reduce overfitting.
Ran program to test multiple different variations of CNN model, by way of variations in number of layers, layer size, window size and regularisation.
Displayed results in Tensorboard by way of callbacks.
